#### Simple Olga Sonia (SOS)

SOS evaluates the probability of generation (P<sub>gen</sub>) and probability in the periphery (P<sub>post</sub>) of specific T and B cell receptor sequences of humans and mice.

SOS also generates synthetic generated and peripheral repertoires of naive cells.

SOS is built on top of the [IGOR](https://github.com/qmarcou/IGoR)\[2\], [OLGA](https://github.com/zsethna/OLGA)\[3\] and [SONIA](https://github.com/statbiophys/SONIA/)\[4,5\] software.

P<sub>gen</sub> is conditioned on productivity of the sequence. It only takes into account VDJ recombination in the absence of selection. P<sub>post</sub> takes selection into account, and should better reflect frequency of occurrence in the periphery. However note that it is insensitive to HLA type. The models were learned on a possibly biased panel of individuals and may depend on the sequencing technologies used. For more accurate dataset-specific comparisons it is advised to infer new models using IGOR and SONIA.

Evaluate command:
`sonia-evaluate --humanTRB CASSTGNYGAFF --v_mask TRBV9 --j_mask TRBJ-1`

<br />

Generate command:
`sonia-generate --humanTRB -n 1000 --pgen (or --ppost)`
